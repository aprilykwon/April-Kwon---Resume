### Overview

I am applying to Ada Developers Academy with the hopes of not only learning how to program, but also becoming an effective member of a team, learning management skills, and becoming a successful woman in a male dominated field. I know Ada will appreciate my passion for gender equality and compassion, as well as the various other perspectives I can offer the classroom as a mixed-race, queer woman.
