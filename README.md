### Overview

I am applying to Ada Developers Academy to knock down my personal fear of failure, and to really apply myself to build a better skillset for future careers. I want to learn how to work better in a team environment (supporting others, asking for help). I know I can learn so much from Ada, and also offer perspectives as an Asian woman growing up in middle-America. I am excited to work with others at Ada, and help to foster a creative, diverse, and supportive environment.

### Goals
* To build on a skillset that allows me to appeal to companies in my field of interest (Gaming and Web-design)
* To have a career where I am financially independent, and can contribute to my personal needs as well as organizations/causes I want to support
